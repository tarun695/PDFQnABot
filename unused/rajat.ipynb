Targeted drug delivery see ks \\nto concentrate the medication in the tissues of \\ninterest while reducing the relative concentration of \\nthe medication in the remaining tissues. This \\nimproves efficacy of the while reducing side effect s. \\nThis improves efficacy of the while reducing side \\neffects. Drug targeting is the delivery of drugs to  \\nreceptors or organs or any other specific part of t he \\nbody to which one wishes to deliver the drugs   \\nexclusively. The drug’s therapeutic index, as \\nmeasured by its pharmacological response and \\nsafety, relies in the access and specific  introduction \\nof the drug with its candidate receptor, whilst minimizing its introduction with non –target tissue . \\nThe desired differential distribution of drug its \\ntargeted delivery would spare the rest of the body \\nand thus significantly reduce the overall toxicity \\nwhile maintaining its therapeutic benefits   The \\ntargeted or site- specific delivery of drugs is ind eed a \\nvery attractive goal because this provides one of t he \\nmost potential ways to improve the therapeutic inde x \\nof the drugs.    \\n \\nRecent approaches \\nQuantam dots: A quantum dot is a semiconductor \\nnanostructure that confines the motion of conductio n \\nband electrons, valence band holes, or excitons \\n(bound pairs of conduction band electrons and \\nvalence band holes) in all three spatial directions . \\nThe confinement can be due to electrostatic \\npotentials (generated by external electrodes, dopin g, ', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/drug.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

A \\ntransdermal drug delivery device, which may be of \\nan active or a passive design, is a device which \\nprovides an alternative route for administering \\nmedication. These devices allow for pharmaceuticals  \\nto be delivered across the skin barrier. In theory,  \\ntransdermal patches work very simply.  A drug is \\napplied in a relatively high dosage to the inside o f a \\npatch, which is worn on the skin for an extended \\nperiod of time.  Through a diffusion process, the \\ndrug enters the bloodstream directly through the \\nskin.  Since there is high concentration on the pat ch and low concentration in the blood, the drug will \\nkeep diffusing into the blood for a long period of \\ntime, maintaining the constant concentration of dru g \\nin the blood flow. \\n                                              \\n                                 \\n \\n \\nFolate Targeting: Folate targeting is a method \\nutilized in biotechnology for drug delivery purpose s. \\nIt involves the attachment of the vitamin, folate \\n(folic acid), to a molecule/drug to form a \"folate \\nconjugate\". Based on the natural high affinity of \\nfolate for the folate receptor protein (FR), which is \\ncommonly expressed on the surface of many human \\ncancers, folate-drug conjugates also bind tightly t o \\nthe FR and trigger cellular uptake via endocytosis.  \\nMolecules as diverse as small radiodiagnostic \\nimaging agents to large DNA plasmid formulations \\nhave successfully been delivered inside FR-positive  \\ncells and tissues. FA also displays high affinity f or \\nthe folate receptor (FR), a \\nglycosylphosphatidyinositol-linked protein that \\ncaptures its ligands from the extracellular milieu and \\ntransports them inside the cell via a non-destructi ve, \\nrecycling endosomal pathway.  The FR is also a \\nrecognized tumor antigen/biomarker. Because of \\nthis, diagnostic and therapeutic methods which \\nexploit the FR’s function are being developed for \\ncancer.   \\n \\nBrain targeted drug delivery system: The brain is \\na delicate organ, and evolution built very efficien t \\nways to protect it.

Quantum \\ndots are particularly significant for optical \\napplications due to their theoretically high quantu m \\nyield. The ability to tune the size of quantum dots  is \\nadvantageous for many applications and it is one of  \\nthe most promising candidates for use in solid-stat e \\nquantum computation and diagnosis , drug delivery, \\nTissue engineering, catalysis, filtration and also \\ntextiles technologies. \\n \\n                         \\n \\n \\n \\nTransdermal Approach: Transdermal drug delivery \\nsystem is topically administered medicaments in the  \\nform of patches that deliver drugs for systemic \\neffects at a predetermined and controlled rate. A \\ntransdermal drug delivery device, which may be of \\nan active or a passive design, is a device which \\nprovides an alternative route for administering \\nmedication. These devices allow for pharmaceuticals  \\nto be delivered across the skin barrier. In theory,  \\ntransdermal patches work very simply.  A drug is \\napplied in a relatively high dosage to the inside o f a \\npatch, which is worn on the skin for an extended \\nperiod of time.  Through a diffusion process, the \\ndrug enters the bloodstream directly through the \\nskin.  Since there is high concentration on the pat ch and low concentration in the blood, the drug will \\nkeep diffusing into the blood for a long period of \\ntime, maintaining the constant concentration of dru g \\nin the blood flow. \\n                                              \\n                                 \\n \\n \\nFolate Targeting: Folate targeting is a method \\nutilized in biotechnology for drug delivery purpose s. \\nIt involves the attachment of the vitamin, folate \\n(folic acid), to a molecule/drug to form a \"folate \\nconjugate\". Based on the natural high affinity of \\nfolate for the folate receptor protein (FR), which is \\ncommonly expressed on the surface of many human \\ncancers, folate-drug conjugates also bind tightly t o \\nthe FR and trigger cellular uptake via endocytosis.  \\nMolecules as diverse as small radiodiagnostic \\nimaging agents to large DNA plasmid formulations \\nhave successfully been delivered inside FR-positive  \\ncells and tissues. FA also displays high affinity f or \\nthe folate receptor (FR), a \\nglycosylphosphatidyinositol-linked protein that \\ncaptures its ligands from the extracellular milieu and \\ntransports them inside the cell via a non-destructi ve, \\nrecycling endosomal pathway.  The FR is also a \\nrecognized tumor antigen/biomarker. Because of \\nthis, diagnostic and therapeutic methods which \\nexploit the FR’s function are being developed for \\ncancer.   \\n \\nBrain targeted drug delivery system: The brain is \\na delicate organ, and evolution built very efficien t \\nways to protect it.

Targeted drug delivery see ks \\nto concentrate the medication in the tissues of \\ninterest while reducing the relative concentration of \\nthe medication in the remaining tissues. This \\nimproves efficacy of the while reducing side effect s. \\nThis improves efficacy of the while reducing side \\neffects. Drug targeting is the delivery of drugs to  \\nreceptors or organs or any other specific part of t he \\nbody to which one wishes to deliver the drugs   \\nexclusively. The drug’s therapeutic index, as \\nmeasured by its pharmacological response and \\nsafety, relies in the access and specific  introduction \\nof the drug with its candidate receptor, whilst minimizing its introduction with non –target tissue . \\nThe desired differential distribution of drug its \\ntargeted delivery would spare the rest of the body \\nand thus significantly reduce the overall toxicity \\nwhile maintaining its therapeutic benefits   The \\ntargeted or site- specific delivery of drugs is ind eed a \\nvery attractive goal because this provides one of t he \\nmost potential ways to improve the therapeutic inde x \\nof the drugs.    \\n \\nRecent approaches \\nQuantam dots: A quantum dot is a semiconductor \\nnanostructure that confines the motion of conductio n \\nband electrons, valence band holes, or excitons \\n(bound pairs of conduction band electrons and \\nvalence band holes) in all three spatial directions . \\nThe confinement can be due to electrostatic \\npotentials (generated by external electrodes, dopin g,', metadata={'source': 'pdfs/drug.pdf', 'page': 0})]\n"
